This lab is based on "express" framework, also you will need "adm-zip", and "multer",
you need to create an "upload" file to store all the uploading files, also you need to create a folder under "upload" called "unzip" to 
store the files extracted from the "zip" file.

whole file structure is like:

>node_modules
>uploads
    >unzip
>form.html
>server.js
>package.json
>README
>.gitignore
